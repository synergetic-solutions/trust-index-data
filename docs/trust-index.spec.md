# Trust Index — Feature Specification

**Product:** Trust Index, a compliance signal directory at `synergetic.solutions/trust-index`
**Owner:** Jeff Smolinski, Synergetic Solutions
**Status:** Approved for implementation
**Date:** 2026-08-25
**Tracking:** GitHub issues on `synergergetic-solutions-site` (cross-referenced per section)

---

## 1. Overview and User Value

Trust Index is a programmatic directory of companies with a **public compliance footprint**: organizations that publicly advertise security and compliance posture through trust centers, security.txt files, and public registries. It replicates the lineara marketing-site pattern (7,000+ generated pages funneling to a conversion goal) for Synergetic Solutions.

One project serves all three practice buckets:

- **GRC**: the directory content itself, tied to the "GRC at the ideation stage" article thesis.
- **Data engineering**: the pipeline is a public case study.
- **Product/market strategy**: segment benchmarks serve founders doing market discovery.

**Audiences and value:**

| Audience | Value | Funnel |
|---|---|---|
| SaaS founders (primary ICP) | Segment posture benchmarks; "what is table stakes in my market" | Discovery call CTA, scorecard |
| Vendor-review searchers ("{company} SOC 2") | Per-company profile pages | Domain authority, backlinks |
| Sales/BD at security vendors, auditors | Prospect list exports | Partner leads, HubSpot capture |
| Listed companies | Claim/correct profile, badge | Verified-email leads |

**Honest framing rule (load-bearing):** the directory reports *publicly advertised* posture only. All copy uses "publicly advertises" / "no public compliance page found as of {date}". HIPAA is described as a claim, never a certification (no HIPAA certification exists). This framing is the defamation shield and the editorial standard.

## 2. Decision Record

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| DEC-01 | Universe = companies with a public compliance footprint | Advertised posture is the measurable, defensible, and thesis-relevant population |
| DEC-02 | Name/URL: **Trust Index** at `/trust-index` | Brandable, matches signal-index framing; slugs frozen from launch |
| DEC-03 | V1 scope includes claims flow + scorecard lead magnet | Owner decision; launch with demand capture live |
| DEC-04 | Two-level segment taxonomy: ~12 parents, ~40 children | Benchmarks at parent level, hub pages at both |
| DEC-05 | Licensing: **open core split** | Core facts CC BY 4.0; enriched layers proprietary (see §8) |
| DEC-13 | Company summaries: **Wikipedia extract when present, else LLM fallback** | Authoritative neutral prose where an article exists; uniform coverage otherwise. Wikipedia text is CC BY-SA (attributed, kept distinct from the CC BY 4.0 core); LLM-generated summaries are original |
| DEC-06 | Storage: Parquet snapshots in GCS, lifecycle tiering; BigQuery via external tables (or `bq load`) | Both round to ~$0 at this scale; Parquet is the neutral format |
| DEC-07 | Common Crawl access: DuckDB reading Parquet over HTTPS (free tier) | Owner accepted slower/free over Athena ~$5-15/refresh |
| DEC-08 | Refresh cadence: monthly full; corrections deploy on merge | Matches CC crawl rhythm and trust-center churn |
| DEC-09 | Three-repo topology (see §3); NAS = self-hosted runner on **private** repos only | Fork-PR code execution on self-hosted runners is the hard security constraint |
| DEC-10 | Hosting: stay on Cloudflare Pages; free tier ≤ ~15k files, then paid (100k limit, `PAGES_WRANGLER_MAJOR_VERSION=4`) | Limit is now purchasable; no migration needed; keep dist/ host-neutral |
| DEC-11 | Issue tracker is an inbox, never a store; validated submissions materialize as committed override files | Snapshots stay self-contained; no replaying the tracker |
| DEC-12 | Launch target 3,000–6,000 profiles; projected universe 5,000–12,000 | Measured: 307 vendor-CNAME hits in Tranco top 30k + CDN-fronted + tail + vendor-hosted |
| DEC-14 | Discovery uses **four vectors**: multi-crawl Common Crawl union + domain-list DNS sweep + subprocessor snowball, over subdomain prefixes `trust/security/compliance/trustcenter/trust-center` | Each vector covers a different miss: crawl coverage, `noindex` pages, and net-new companies. `status.` dropped (0 trust-center yield). Vendor-hosted-portal and security.txt-via-crawl vectors probed and found weak (noindex; rarely crawled) |
| DEC-15 | Registries built: **FedRAMP + EU-US DPF** (open JSON); CSA STAR and Visa PCI deferred | CSA STAR is reCAPTCHA-gated, Visa PCI is a bulk file. Matching is exact on a normalized name key (domain stem + company name) — high-precision to avoid mis-attributing a certification |
| DEC-16 | A **data-quality gate** runs before publish (completeness, validity, uniqueness, consistency, plausibility) and fails the release on defects | Caught malformed Tranco `_wildcard_.*`/bare-TLD seeds; added a `valid_domain()` filter in response |
| DEC-17 | **Registry cross-referencing removed** (2026-08-31); supersedes DEC-15. FR-N2 suspended | Sample audit found the sole FedRAMP match was a false positive (`artera.ai` vs FedRAMP's Artera at artera.io) and a DPF match unverifiable (`assembly.com` vs "Assembly") — stem-only matching mis-attributes on dictionary-word stems, the exact defamation risk DEC-15 tried to avoid. Reinstatement requires name-key corroboration + a matched-pair audit; implementation preserved in pipeline git history |

Spike evidence (2026-08-25): 60k DNS probes → 4,726 resolved hosts, 307 confirmed vendor CNAMEs (Vanta 129, SafeBase/Drata 143, Conveyor 25, others); extraction validated on all four major vendor templates (Vanta via same-host GraphQL `fetchDataForTrustReport`); Wayback first-archive dates for 4/6 sampled trust centers; Wikidata: 17/24 entities, 13 with Crunchbase org ID (P2088); security.txt adoption 71/300 top domains; ISO 42001 already present on Rippling and OpenAI trust pages; Greenhouse public job API validated (Mercury, Sendbird).

**Build results (2026-08-27)** — pipeline stages TI-02..TI-08 built in `trust-index-pipeline` (discover → extract → enrich → publish → quality), all validated live on Common Crawl CC-MAIN-2026-34..21. Discovery: 4-crawl union 3,935 entities; + Tranco top-20k sweep +194 new; + snowball (60-host sample) +11 new → **6,194 distinct entities** after the `valid_domain` cleanup (62 malformed removed). Extraction: 3 vendor API clients + HTML fallback; a 150-host sample gave 73% with frameworks. Enrichment: identity/summaries/timelines/posture/hiring/registries — 150-host sample 91% summaries, 100% vendor, all values valid/unique/consistent (0 quality FAILs). Prefix yield probe (Tranco top-8k): trust 119, security 17, compliance 7, trustcenter 5. Method detail in the pipeline repo's `docs/methods.md`. Still pending on TI-08: GCS upload with lifecycle tiering, BigQuery external table, and the versioned release PR to `trust-index-data`.

## 3. Architecture

```
[Private pipeline repo]           [Public data repo]              [Private site repo]
 NAS self-hosted runner            GitHub-hosted runners           synergergetic-solutions-site
 crawl / enrich / classify   --->  data releases (versioned)  ---> pulls pinned release at build
 Parquet -> GCS (+ BQ ext.)  <---  overrides/ (validated)          /trust-index/* pages
 secrets live here only            issue forms, badge assets       Cloudflare Pages deploy
                                   verification Actions            repository_dispatch rebuilds
```

- **Private pipeline repo**: crawlers, enrichment, LLM classification, secrets. Runs on the NAS runner (Docker, label `nas-heavy`; self-hosted jobs escape the 6-hour cap and keep persistent caches: CC index extractions, Wayback results, crawl snapshots).
- **Public data repo**: released open-core dataset, `overrides/`, issue forms, badge assets, docs (this spec's eventual canonical home), validation workflows on GitHub-hosted runners (free for public repos). **Never** attach the NAS runner here.
- **Site repo**: look and feel, `/trust-index` routes, HubSpot worker. Consumes data releases; never consumes the issue tracker.

**Storage:** each refresh writes immutable dated Parquet snapshots (+ convenience `.duckdb`) to GCS. Lifecycle: Standard → Coldline at 90 days → Archive at 1 year. BigQuery external tables point at the same Parquet when needed. Raw HTML crawl archive (~1GB compressed/refresh) retained for provenance.

---

## 4. Functional Requirements — Data Pipeline (EARS)

### Discovery
- **FR-D1**: When a monthly refresh runs, the pipeline shall enumerate candidate hosts matching `trust.*`, `security.*`, and `status.*` from the newest Common Crawl host index via column-pruned DuckDB reads over HTTPS.
- **FR-D2**: When candidate hosts are enumerated, the pipeline shall resolve each via DNS and classify trust-center vendor by CNAME signature (vantatrust.com, portals.safebase.io, whistic.com, Conveyor/aptible, secureframetrust.com, securitypal.com, hypercomplytrust.com, extensible list).
- **FR-D3**: When a host resolves without a known vendor CNAME (CDN-fronted or A-only), the pipeline shall fetch and content-classify the page before inclusion or exclusion.
- **FR-D4**: The pipeline shall preserve existing organization slugs across refreshes (slug freeze; renames via display-only overrides).

### Extraction
- **FR-E1**: When a trust center is confirmed, the pipeline shall extract advertised frameworks using the vendor-specific parser (SafeBase/Drata, Whistic, Conveyor: server-rendered HTML; Vanta: same-host GraphQL `fetchDataForTrustReport`).
- **FR-E2**: The framework taxonomy shall include at minimum: SOC 2 (Type I/II), SOC 3, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 42001, HIPAA (claim), PCI DSS, GDPR, FedRAMP, StateRAMP/TX-RAMP, HITRUST, TISAX, DPF.
- **FR-E3**: When a trust center discloses subprocessors, the pipeline shall extract them and maintain the cross-directory subprocessor graph, including the chain-trust metric (share of an org's subprocessors that themselves publish trust centers).
- **FR-E4**: Every extracted fact shall carry an `observed_at` timestamp and evidence URL.

### Enrichment
- **FR-N1**: The pipeline shall resolve each organization's identity via Wikidata (P856 homepage match) capturing QID, Crunchbase org ID (P2088), LinkedIn (P4264), industry, founding year, HQ, ticker, LEI; fallback: homepage schema.org/footer link extraction, then Common Crawl existence check for `crunchbase.com/organization/{slug}`. Crunchbase is linked, never scraped. A deterministic BuiltWith profile link (`builtwith.com/{domain}`) is included link-only; BuiltWith data is never scraped (phase 2 may self-detect a security-relevant tech subset from already-fetched homepages via an open fingerprint DB).
- **FR-N2** *(suspended per DEC-17)*: The pipeline shall cross-reference public registries: CSA STAR, Visa Global Registry (PCI), FedRAMP Marketplace, EU-US DPF participant list. Reinstatement requires a matcher with name-key corroboration and an audited false-positive rate.
- **FR-N3**: The pipeline shall fetch and parse `/.well-known/security.txt` and compute a DNS posture score (SPF, DMARC, DNSSEC).
- **FR-N4**: The pipeline shall compute compliance timelines: earliest observed trust center via Wayback CDX, backfilled from Common Crawl historical indexes, expressed strictly as "first observed".
- **FR-N5**: The pipeline shall detect GRC hiring signals via public Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby board APIs (titles matching compliance/GRC/security/risk/privacy/trust).
- **FR-N6**: The pipeline shall classify each organization into the two-level taxonomy (12 parents / ~40 children) via LLM pass over homepage content, corroborated by Wikidata industry; only new/changed organizations re-classify on refresh.
- **FR-N7**: The pipeline shall attach a one-paragraph company summary: the English Wikipedia extract (resolved via the Wikidata sitelink) when the entity has one, attributed to Wikipedia under CC BY-SA; otherwise an LLM-generated summary grounded in the company's homepage/trust-center content. Each record stores the summary and its `summarySource` (`wikipedia` | `llm`). Only new/changed organizations re-summarize on refresh. (POC: measured coverage was 136 Wikipedia + 176 homepage-grounded of 330; the POC fallback surfaces the homepage/OG description as the grounding text the production LLM pass normalizes.)

### Merge, Overrides, Publishing
- **FR-M1**: The pipeline shall merge sources in fixed precedence: base extraction → registry enrichments → overrides layer (highest, per-field).
- **FR-M2**: When an override's evidence URL is dead or contradicted by fresh extraction, the refresh PR shall flag it for human review rather than silently applying or dropping it.
- **FR-M3**: When a refresh completes, the pipeline shall publish: (a) dated Parquet snapshot to GCS, (b) versioned data release (derived JSON + open-core files) to the public data repo, (c) a data-refresh PR (lineara pattern).
- **FR-M4**: Where a benchmark statistic is published for a cohort, the cohort shall meet a minimum size threshold (default n≥30) or the hub shall omit the statistic.

---

## 5. Functional Requirements — Site (EARS)

- **FR-S1**: The site shall render `/trust-index/{company-slug}` profiles, `/trust-index/segment/{segment}` and `/trust-index/framework/{framework}` hubs, and `/trust-index/reports/{slug}` from the pinned data release via a content collection (`file()` loader, Zod-validated), reusing `Layout.astro`, Navigation, and contact CTA.
- **FR-S2**: Profile pages shall display: a company summary with a visible source attribution (Wikipedia vs. generated, per FR-N7), market segment (linking to the segment-filtered index), advertised frameworks with as-of date, identity links (sameAs), timeline, hiring signal, subprocessors (bidirectional links), registry cross-references, claim/correct CTA, discovery-call CTA.
- **FR-S3**: When a data release or override merges, `repository_dispatch` shall trigger a site rebuild (corrections live in minutes; full data monthly).
- **FR-S4**: Articles shall cross-link profiles via the existing `:::spoke` directive; profiles link related articles by segment.
- **FR-S5 (SEO, full complement)**: The site shall implement: canonical tags + trailing-slash policy; OG/Twitter cards with og:type per page type; article published/modified meta; JSON-LD per type (Organization+WebSite home; BlogPosting articles; ProfilePage+Organization+sameAs profiles; CollectionPage+ItemList hubs; Dataset for the corpus; BreadcrumbList throughout); CI test validating JSON-LD in built `dist/`; sitemap `lastmod` from data timestamps; methodology page linked from every directory footer; llms.txt/llms-full.txt extended to articles + directory; RSS for articles + a monthly changes feed; IndexNow ping on deploy; `_redirects` for renames; `noIndex` on filter views; per-page OG images (Satori) for hubs + claimed profiles at launch (file-count budget), all pages once on paid tier.

---

## 6. Functional Requirements — Claims & Corrections (EARS)

- **FR-C1**: The public data repo shall provide three issue forms: claim profile, request correction, submit company; profile pages link prefilled issue-form URLs.
- **FR-C2**: When a correction cites public evidence, a GitHub Action shall re-crawl/verify the evidence and open an overrides PR automatically; human merge required.
- **FR-C3**: Where an override is subjective (description, segment), the requester shall prove domain control via DNS TXT challenge or email from the organization's domain.
- **FR-C4**: Validated submissions shall be committed as `data/overrides/{org-id}.yml` with field, value, evidence URL, verification method, date, and originating issue link; the issue closes on merge.
- **FR-C5**: When a profile is claimed, the site shall mark it claimed and offer the embeddable badge (links back to the profile).
- **FR-C6**: "We hold X but do not publish it" shall be answered by policy with "publish it and we will pick it up"; unverifiable posture claims are never accepted.

---

## 7. Functional Requirements — Lead Magnets & HubSpot (EARS)

All gates run through one Cloudflare Worker seam + HubSpot Forms API; consent checkbox at every gate; HubSpot handles opt-in mechanics.

- **FR-L1 (v1)**: **Scorecard**: when a visitor submits their domain + email, the Worker shall run live checks (trust-center DNS, security.txt, DMARC, framework detection), compute segment percentile against the directory, submit the contact to HubSpot, and email the report.
- **FR-L2 (v1)**: **Prospect/benchmark exporter**: an island on the directory index shall filter by segment/framework/signals, and gate CSV export on email; the Worker shall record filter selections as HubSpot contact properties (intent data).
- **FR-L3 (phase 2)**: **Watchlists**: monthly refresh diffs shall drive per-user change alert emails.
- **FR-L4 (phase 2)**: **Segment report PDFs** auto-generated per segment hub, gated; web version ungated.
- **FR-L5 (phase 2)**: **Changes newsletter** as the nurture backbone.
- **FR-L6**: HTML pages are never gated; only export/report formats are.

---

## 8. Licensing & Monetization

**Open core split (DEC-05):**

- **Open core** (CC BY 4.0, published in data repo + Dataset JSON-LD → Google Dataset Search): org identity (name, domain, slug), parent+child segment, advertised framework list, as-of date, profile URL.
- **Proprietary enriched** (terms-of-use contract at every gate; never CC-released, preserving the one-way ratchet): compliance timelines, hiring signals, subprocessor graph + chain-trust, historical diffs/snapshots, registry cross-references, DNS posture scores.
- **Third-party-licensed** (kept out of both tiers above, carrying their own terms): Wikipedia-sourced company summaries are CC BY-SA 4.0 — attributed to Wikipedia and never relicensed under the CC BY 4.0 core; LLM-generated summaries are original and follow whichever tier they are placed in. The `summarySource` field records provenance so downstream consumers can honor the right license.

**Monetization paths preserved:** (1) self-serve segment exports $99–299 one-time; full enriched subscription $299–499/mo (BuiltWith anchor); enterprise/API licensing $10k–50k/yr (cyber insurers, TPRM platforms, compliance vendors). (2) RL/evals play: verifiable web-research environment graded against maintained ground truth; monthly refresh yields contamination-resistant eval sets; path = publish small open "TrustBench" cut for credibility, license commercial environment on demand. Year-two option; costs nothing to preserve. Steganographic fingerprinting of enriched exports for copy detection; no fictitious entries ever.

---

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-1 Runtime**: first full run ≤ ~24h unattended; monthly incremental ≤ 8h on the NAS runner.
- **NFR-2 Politeness**: crawl ≤ 1 req/sec/domain, honest User-Agent with contact URL, respect robots.txt; Wayback/Wikidata calls throttled with backoff.
- **NFR-3 Accuracy**: every published fact carries as-of date + evidence; correction SLA: validated corrections live within 24h of merge; methodology page states collection and correction policy.
- **NFR-4 Security**: self-hosted runner attached to private repos only; secrets only in the private pipeline repo; community content never executes on owned hardware; Worker validates and rate-limits all lead-magnet endpoints.
- **NFR-5 Cost ceiling**: steady-state infra < $10/mo excluding LLM classification (< $25/refresh on Haiku) until paid Cloudflare tier triggers at ~15k files.
- **NFR-6 Build**: site build ≤ 10 min at 6k pages; lazy per-company JSON only where it pays (file-count budget).

---

## 10. Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then, representative)

1. Given a fresh clone of the site repo and a pinned data release, when `npm run build` runs, then all `/trust-index` pages build with valid JSON-LD (CI test passes) and the sitemap includes them with `lastmod`.
2. Given Mercury's trust center advertises SOC 2 Type II, when the refresh runs, then Mercury's profile shows SOC 2 Type II with an as-of date and evidence link, within the vendor parser (Vanta/GraphQL) path.
3. Given a company with no public compliance page, when its profile is viewed, then copy reads "no public compliance page found as of {date}" and never asserts non-compliance.
4. Given a correction issue citing a live trust-center URL showing ISO 27001, when the verification Action runs, then an overrides PR is opened with evidence recorded, and on merge the site rebuilds and the issue closes.
5. Given a visitor submits domain + email to the scorecard, when the Worker completes, then a HubSpot contact exists with score properties and the visitor receives the report email.
6. Given a segment cohort of n<30, when its hub renders, then no percentage benchmark claim appears.
7. Given a prior snapshot exists in GCS, when the monthly refresh completes, then a new dated snapshot exists, the old one is untouched, and a data-release PR is open.

## 11. Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| CC index pull fails mid-stream | Resume from cached shards on NAS; refresh continues with prior month's host list + delta flagged |
| Trust page unreachable at refresh | Retain prior data, mark `stale_since`; drop framework claims after 2 consecutive missed refreshes with flag in PR |
| Vendor template change breaks parser | Extraction test fixtures fail in CI before bad data publishes; refresh PR blocked |
| Wikidata/Wayback rate limits | Backoff + resume; enrichment is incremental so partial completion is safe |
| Override evidence URL dead | Flag in refresh PR (FR-M2), never silent |
| Issue form submission unverifiable | Action comments with policy explanation ("publish it and we'll pick it up"); no override created |
| Scorecard domain has no footprint | Report renders honestly with zero-state guidance + CTA, never an error |
| HubSpot API down | Worker queues submission (KV) and retries; visitor still receives download/report |
| Cloudflare file count approaches 15k | CI warns at 12k; upgrade runbook in docs (DEC-10) |

### Build status (as of 2026-08-27)

Pipeline (`trust-index-pipeline`), method detail in that repo's `docs/methods.md`:

- **TI-01** ◑ pipeline project scaffolded (uv, CLI, CI); NAS self-hosted runner is the remaining manual step.
- **TI-02** ✅ built — four discovery vectors (multi-crawl union, domain-list sweep, subprocessor snowball) over the widened prefix set.
- **TI-03** ✅ built — Vanta / SafeBase-Drata / Conveyor API clients + HTML fallback; parse logic unit-tested.
- **TI-04** ✅ built — Wikidata identity, security.txt + DNS posture, summaries (Wikipedia→homepage). BuiltWith is a site-side link. Registries were built, then removed after a false-positive audit (DEC-17).
- **TI-05** ✅ built — Wayback timelines + Greenhouse hiring signals.
- **TI-06** ✅ built — subprocessor extraction (Vanta) + chain-trust metric computed at publish (share of disclosed subprocessors present in the index; URL→registrable-domain matching only, undercounts rather than fabricates). Method: pipeline `docs/chain-trust.md`. On the 2026-08-31 release: 1,037 orgs, 11,106 edges, median share 67%.
- **TI-07** ✗ not built — segment classification is not yet a pipeline stage (hand-done in the POC).
- **TI-08** ✅ built — merge + dated Parquet snapshot + derived site JSON; GCS upload with Coldline/Archive lifecycle (`gs://trust-index-synergetic-data`, keyless WIF auth from the refresh workflow); BigQuery external table `trust_index.snapshots`; monthly cron (the 3rd, 06:00 UTC) resolving the newest Common Crawl indexes live; open-core CC BY 4.0 release (`trust-index-open.json`) cut at publish and PR'd into `data/open/` each refresh (human merge). Prior release for slug freeze + incremental classify is fetched from GCS with the committed seed as fallback.
- **Data-quality gate** ✅ built (`quality` command, DEC-16), not a numbered ticket.

Site/claims/lead-magnet tracks (TI-09..TI-16) exist as a POC on the `trust-index-poc` branch of the site repo (routes, profiles, filters, segment, summaries, SEO/JSON-LD), pending productionization against a pipeline-produced release.
